# War for Africa
2D SFML Risk variant

War for Africa is an open-source, cross-platform game written in C++.
It depends on the SFML library for rendering, audio, and network functions.
The game is based off of the classic board game "Risk."
It was developed by Jonathan Heinz.

#Installation

To install on linux, clone this repository and run the usual build commands:

`make`

Because this repo is in pre-alpha, there is no `make install` command (yet). You may run the game by simply typing `./main`.

This code has been tested to compile on Windows under MinGW, using g++ 4.8.1. Compilation is the same as in linux. Type `make` to compile, and `main` to run.
